This repository is a template that everyone can use for the start of their twitch bot.

When I first started creating my twitch bot it took me a while to get everything setup and working with cogs and more. I would've been happy if there were any template existing. But there wasn't any existing template. That's why I decided to create my own template to let <b>you</b> guys create your twitch bot in an easy way.

Please note that this template is not supposed to be the best template, but a good template to start learning how TwitchIO works and to make your own bot in a simple way.

If you plan to use this template to make your own template or bot, please give me credits, it would be greatly appreciated.

## How to setup

To setup the bot I made it as simple as possible. I now created a [config.yaml](config.yaml) file where you can put the needed things to edit.

Here is an explanation of what everything is:

| Variable                      | What it is                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------            | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| authentication_bearer         | This will be generated when you need it, so don't touch it.                                                                                                           |
| bot_version                   | This the current bot version                                                                                                                                          |
| channel                       | The name of the channel that you want your bot to manage.                                                                                                             |
| channel_id                    | This will be generated when you need it, so don't touch it.                                                                                                           |
| client_id                     | You need to create a console application [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/create) and then a client id will be given.                                        |
| client_secret                 | Click on "Manage" for your bot [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps) and then click "New Secret", a secret "token" will be shown.                                |
| colored_logs                  | When logging the logs can be colored or not. I recommend to put `true` only if you are running the bot on MacOS, Linux or Windows 10 with Windows Terminal installed  |
| nick                          | The nickname that you want to give to your bot (I recommend to give the same name as the twitch account)                                                              |
| prefix                        | The prefix that can be used for the bot, it is made for one prefix only. Soon you I will make multiple prefixes possible                                              |
| startup_cogs                  | Ã‚ list of cogs that are being automatically loaded when starting the bot.                                                                                             |
| token                         | An OAuth token for the twitch account can be generated [here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/), please keep `oauth:`.                                                     |


## How to start

To start the bot you simply need to launch, either your terminal (Linux, Mac & Windows) or your Command Prompt (Windows).

If you have multiple versions of python installed (2.x and 3.x) then you will need to use the following command:
```
python3 bot.py
```
or eventually
```
python3.8 bot.py
```
<br>

If you have just installed python today, then you just need to use the following command:
```
python bot.py
```

## Requirements
All the requirements can be found in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

To install them simply run the following command in either your terminal (Linux, Mac & Windows) or your Command Prompt (Windows)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
